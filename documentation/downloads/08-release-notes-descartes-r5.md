  - `-Ddisablereconsearchinhistoryforleavers=true`
    Disable the search of identities in history when renewing a 'leave' reconciliation.
    When a 'leave' reconciliation exists in the previous timeslot, the product tries to find the latest reconciliation in the history to        find the identity and renew this one if the identity exists in the current timeslot.
  - `-Ddisablereconsearchinhistoryfororphans=true`
    Disable the search of reconciliation in history when renewing an 'orphan' reconciliation.
    When no reconciliation is found for an account in the previous timeslot, the product tries to find the latest reconciliation in the         history to renew it (either identity or service reconciliation) in the current timeslot.
