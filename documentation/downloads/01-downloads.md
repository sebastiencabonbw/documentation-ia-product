## Checking the integrity of the download

In order to verify the integrity of the downloaded file you can also download the associated .sha1 checksum file that contains the correct sha1 hash.

To verify the file:

```sh
iGRCAnalyticsSetup_win32_x64_Descartes-R5-SP3_2024-12-09.exe
```

You can download the checksum file:

```sh
iGRCAnalyticsSetup_win32_x64_Descartes-R5-SP3_2024-12-09.sha1
```

You can calculate the SHA1 of your downloaded file and it should match exactly with the hash in the ".sha1" file.

## How to calculate the hash?

### Windows

#### Get-FileHash

In Powershell you can use the commandlet `Get-FileHash` to compute the hash value for a file by using a specified hash algorithm.

Please use the following link for more information.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-6

#### Certutil

In windows, you can use the command line tool certutil:

```sh
Certutil -hashfile iGRCAnalyticsSetup_win32_x64_Descartes-R5-SP3_2024-12-09.exe SHA1
```

#### Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier

You can also download the Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11533)

```sh
fciv.exe -sha1 iGRCAnalyticsSetup_win32_x64_Descartes-R5-SP3_2024-12-09.exe
```

### Unix/Linux

Most unix-like operating systems include the tools shasum and/or sha1sum

```sh
shasum iGRCAnalyticsSetup_win32_x64_Descartes-R5-SP3_2024-12-09.exe
sha1sum iGRCAnalyticsSetup_win32_x64_Descartes-R5-SP3_2024-12-09.exe
```

Finally, if shasum (or sha1sum) is available, the verification can done directly using the .sha1 file:

```bash
shasum -c iGRCAnalyticsSetup_win32_x64_Descartes-R5-SP3_2024-12-09.sha1
```

## Drivers
