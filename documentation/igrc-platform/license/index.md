## Overview

You can use a web service to view detailed information about your Identity Analytics licence, including:

- The expiration date and the remaining days
- The maximum/current/remaining identities
- The list of features included in the licence

To download the Identity Analytics licence information PDF, replace the `/portal` string in the URL with `/get_lic_info`.

For example, the URL `http://localhost:8080/demo/portal` should be updated to `http://localhost:8080/demo/get_lic_info`.
