# Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) connector configuration

This documentation describes how to use scripts provided by Identity Analytics to extract the objects (groups, accounts, etc.) from Azure Active Directory (now known as Entra ID) environments. The provided script `azureadmain.py` has been designed to simplify the data extraction to obtain the import files required for the Identity Analytics Azure Active Directory add-on.

The script enables the extraction of objects managed in Azure Active Directory, such as users, groups, group members, and group owners.
The extraction script is stored in `bwconnectors/azureadmain.py`

## Azure Active Directory Configuration

To enable data extraction, an application must be registered in Entra ID. We recommend creating a dedicated application specifically for the Identity Analytics service.

Once you create an application in Entra ID, you will need to store:

* The application (client) Id
* The client secret
* The azure tenant Id

To create and register the application, follow the steps outlined below.  

### Application creation

1. Connect to your Azure Active Directory admin center and navigate to the "All services" page.
2. Click on "Azure Active Directory".

3. Navigate to the "App registrations" tab. 
4. Click "New registration" to register a new application.

5. Enter the desired name for your application, for example "AD Azure Data Extraction".
6. Select the type of accounts that can access the application. We recommend using the single tenant option: "Accounts in the organizational directory only".

7. In Redirect URI, select the "Public client (mobile & desktop)" option in the dedicated combo.
8. Next, click "Register".
9. Once the application is created, copy and store the "Application (client) ID". This parameter will be used in the Identity Analytics service to configure the extractor:

#### Application permission configuration

10. Withtin the newly created app, navigate to the "API permissions" menu.
11. Click on "Add a permission".  
12. Select the "Microsoft Graph" API.

### Extractor validation

Using the controller you can test the configuration of your extractor by performing a test extraction.  

Refer to the controller documentation [here](/containers/controller) for more information.  

The execution of the Azure Active Directory script generates 4 `csv` files. These files are:  

* `domainName_users.csv`
* `domainName_groups.csv`
* `domainName_groups_members.csv`
* `domainName_groups_owners.csv`
