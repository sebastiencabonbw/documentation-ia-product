### Timeslot specific attributes

Some attributes in the `Ledger` (or data model) are **timeslot specific**.  
See [specific attributes linked to time](./getting-started/#specific-attributes-linked-to-time).

### iGRC Purge

You can use **igrc_purge.cmd** either with the purge from the technical configuration (`purge` tab), or by passing the timeslot status (one of the values from above).

> For detailed information on the purge, see [purge of timeslots](02-purge-of-timeslots).
